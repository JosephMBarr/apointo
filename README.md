# a.0

a.0 (a-point-oh) is a nifty extension that turns you into a veritable sabermetrician when it comes to your Powerschool grades. Featuring:

-Your grades displayed in much greater precision

-The ability to input hypothetical assignments to see how your grade would fare

-The converse, inputting the possible points of a hypothetical assignment and the grade you want to see what score you need
(use the blue and grey plus icon in the address bar for these)

-A graph to show the history of your grade throughout the grading period

-Visible weighted grade support 

-Heatmap style outlines on the grades on the homepage to quickly notify you of recently updated grades (now toggleable via options screen)



I worked on this off-and-on throughout high school, but am unable to maintain it due to my graduation. You can install it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/a0-powerschool-enhancemen/lopcdcbkjdojohoahkjlclfmpnfolbfa).
